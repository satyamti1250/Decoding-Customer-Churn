## Insights Discovered

1. **Retention Indicators:** Analyzing a customer base of 7,043, we found a strong retention rate, which suggests successful customer satisfaction and retention efforts.

2. **Service Adoption:** Services such as phone and internet are highly adopted, while others like tech support and online security present opportunities for market expansion through targeted promotions.

3. **Financial Contributions:** Our 'Top 10 Customers by Revenue' analysis highlighted that a small segment of high-paying customers significantly impacts the revenue stream.

4. **Billing Preferences:** The majority of customers prefer electronic checks, which guides the billing strategies and payment processing priorities.

5. **Support Tickets:** The average number of tech and admin tickets per customer is low, indicating fewer service-related issues and a potential marker of high service quality.

6. **Churn Rate vs. Tenure:** We discovered that customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn, suggesting the need for early engagement strategies.

7. **Contract Insights:** Month-to-month customers show the highest churn rate, indicating the necessity for more attractive long-term contract incentives.

8. **Senior Citizen Segment:** This demographic, while only 16.21% of the customer base, contributes disproportionately to the revenue, indicating a high level of service utilization.

9. **Tech Support and Fiber Optic Services:** A particular focus on increasing tech support capacity for Fiber Optic customers aims to reduce tech tickets and enhance customer satisfaction.
